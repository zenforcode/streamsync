# StreamSync
StreamSync is a high-performance Rust-based application for transferring and processing files between different storage locations. It operates on the concept of FlowFiles, which encapsulate both data and metadata, and utilizes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of Processors to govern the movement and transformation of FlowFiles efficiently.

# Features
- FlowFile-based Processing: Each FlowFile consists of data and metadata that can be manipulated by processors.
- DAG-driven Workflow: Movement and transformations are controlled via a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of Processors.
- High-performance Transfers: Optimized for efficient file movement across different storage locations.
- Modular and Extensible: Easily add new processors to modify and route FlowFiles dynamically.
- Rust-Powered: Leverages Rust's safety and concurrency capabilities for a robust system.
# Installation
Ensure you have Rust installed on your system. You can install Rust via rustup:
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
Then, clone the repository and build the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StreamSync.git
cd StreamSync
cargo build --release
```
## Usage
Run the application using:
```
cargo run --release --config config.toml
```

## Configuration
StreamSync requires a configuration file (config.toml) that specifies storage locations and processing rules. Example:
```
[input]
path = "/path/to/source"

[output]
path = "/path/to/destination"

[processors]
flow = ["Encrypt", "Compress", "Upload"]
```
## FlowFile Structure
A FlowFile consists of:

Data: The actual content being transferred.
Metadata: Key-value pairs providing information about the file (e.g., name, size, timestamps).
Example JSON representation of a FlowFile:
```
{
    "data": "base64-encoded-content",
    "metadata": {
        "filename": "example.txt",
        "size": 1024,
        "created_at": "2025-02-06T12:00:00Z"
    }
}
```
## DAG of Processors
Each processor in the DAG takes a set of FlowFiles, performs operations, and passes them forward. Example processors:

EncryptProcessor: Encrypts file content.
CompressProcessor: Compresses files before transfer.
UploadProcessor: Moves FlowFiles to the destination storage.
Example DAG flow:

(Input Storage) → [EncryptProcessor] → [CompressProcessor] → [UploadProcessor] → (Output Storage)
